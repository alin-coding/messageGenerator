# 🦸‍♂️ Random Superhero Name Generator  

Welcome to the **Random Superhero Name Generator!** This fun little project randomly creates superhero names by combining:  

- **An adjective or title** (e.g., Super, Mr., Miss, Captain)  
- **A name** (e.g., Thunder, Shadow, Blaze)  
- **A place of origin** (e.g., from the Underworld, of the Cosmos, of Brooklyn)  

## 🎲 How It Works  
Run the generator, and it will produce a random superhero name like:  
🔥 **Captain Blaze of the Cosmos**  
⚡ **The Incredible Shadow from the Underworld**  
🦸 **Miss Thunder of Brooklyn**  

Each time you run it, you'll get a new, unique name!  

## 🛠️ Built With JavaScript  
This project is powered by **JavaScript**, using arrays and the `Math.random()` function to generate random combinations of adjectives, names, and origins dynamically. 

## 🚀 Purpose  
This project is purely for fun—whether you're looking for inspiration, a laugh, or just a cool superhero alias, this generator has you covered!  

**Maybe you will make the next Marvel character.**
